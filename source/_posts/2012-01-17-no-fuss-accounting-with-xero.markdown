One of the things that always catches up with me at this time of year is my year end accounts.  As a freelancer, keeping track of expenses and invoices throughout the year is something that I have always found a pain and it inevitably gets put on the back burner.  I've been using spreadsheets for the last few years and my client invoicing process has always been somewhat manual.  I needed a better system and was prepared to spend some cash if it met my requirements.  I came across [Xero](http://www.xero.com) after reading a review in [PC Pro](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/software/367120/xero) and decided to give it a go.  I pay Â£12+VAT per month which is slightly more that I wanted to pay but having used it for a month or so I would say that you definitely get what you pay for.

Killer features for me are:
<!-- More -->
1. Cloud based / SaaS solution - access from anywhere.  Nothing to install.  No backups to worry about.
1. Automated bank feed - transactions from my HSBC business current account are sent directly to [Xero](http://www.xero.com) to be reconciled.  Reconciliation is simply a matter of categorising the transaction and clicking 'OK'.  It 'learns' from previous transactions so will suggest an appropriate category for most transactions.
1. Incoming transactions are reconciled against previously generated invoices.
1. Role based access - my accountant has privileges to be able to do all the normal chart of accounts and year end submissions.
1. Invoice generation.  I now produce all my invoices through [Xero](http://www.xero.com).  It's really easy to add line items as I go along and then invoice at the end of the month.  Emails are sent directly from [Xero](http://www.xero.com) to clients.
1. VAT returns - I've yet to try this but will be doing this in a couple of weeks.
1. iPhone App.  A fairly basic app allows you to keep track of accounts and invoices on the go.

It couldn't be simpler.  All I now really need to worry about is keeping paper copies of invoices and receipts in a shoe box to keep the tax man happy.

Conclusion.  I'm really impressed with [Xero](http://www.xero.com).  It's an fine example of a hosted service that just works and is a pleasure to use.  I can see many small companies that currently use spreadsheets, [Sage](http://www.sage.co.uk/) or [Quickbooks](http://www.intuit.co.uk/) migrating to [Xero](http://www.xero.com) in the coming months.
