##What We Do
Interoperate provide consultancy in the following areas:

    - Enterprise Architecture
    - Solution Architecture
    - Systems Integration
    - IT Solution Delivery
    - Agile Software Development using Ruby on Rails

Over the years, we have developed many tools and building blocks based on our wide and varied experience of IT in different industries.  We pride ourselves on being able to adapt to any organisation or business to determine the most effective approach to an IT project and to deliver results.  Whether you are re-defining an enterprise using an EA framework like [TOGAF&reg;](http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/) or developing a prototype system using an [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/) approach, we understand the industry best practices and can help.

##Road Tolling and ITS
As well as providing 'general' IT solution architecture services, we also have specialist knowledge of Intelligent Transport Systems, specifically road tolling (a.k.a road user charging) systems based on RFID, DSRC and GNSS technologies.
