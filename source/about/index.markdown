# Jon Wade

I'm an IT freelancer based in Leeds, UK.  My company is called 'Interoperate Ltd'.  I'm an engineer at heart. A problem solver. I've been working on IT projects of all shapes and sizes since 1998. Prior to that, I spent a few years working in manufacturing as a graduate mechanical engineer but the opportunities presented by the growth of the internet in the mid 1990s were more than enough to lure me into a career in information technology.

I've spent most of my working life employed by global systems integration consultancies in various capacities on some of the largest and smallest IT programmes in the world. From billion pound national IT programmes to bleeding edge prototype solutions on a tiny budget. My experience spans most market sectors, from governments to multinational engineering companies, from defence systems to international banking and transport.

I started my IT career as a UNIX systems administrator. Since then I've worked as an integration engineer, software developer, solution architect and technical delivery manager. I've been freelance since 2008. I understand what it takes to design and deliver successful IT systems and perhaps more importantly, I've also observed the behaviours that can lead to unsuccessful IT programmes.

Historically, I honed my technical skills in the areas of IT infrastructure, application middleware and enterprise messaging and directory systems. Over the last 7 years, I've worked as a solution architect and a delivery manager. I'm also a proficient software developer and over the last few years have been using Ruby on Rails for most projects that I've been involved in.  I tend to focus on the end-to-end process, from eliciting clear business requirements through to the delivery of business services and everything in between.

Outside work, I'm married with a young family. I'm also the lead singer and keyboard player in a band called [The Reason](http://www.thereason.net).

## My Philosophy

The more experience I've gained, the more I've learnt that successful IT programmes are less about technology and more about people doing business. In a nutshell, I'm about delivering value for money to my clients.  I'm not interested in spinning out a contract for as long as possible whilst delivering very little.  I always have my client's interest at heart.  My job is designing and delivering robust business IT systems that enable people to do their jobs but still retain the flexibility to adapt to ever changing business requirements.  If there is an opportunity to work in an [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) way than all the better.

I approach IT projects from a number of viewpoints: as a solution architect; a developer and a service manager.  When working on public sector projects, I also have the viewpoint of a tax payer.  I would argue that even in this 'age of austerity' and cuts in the public sector, it is still all too easy for the work of private sector companies in the public sector to go unchecked and for them to 'leech' funds from the public coffers.  I abhor this.  I do believe that freelancers and the private sector in general have a lot to give to improve the way that the public sector operates but there needs to be an improvement in the way that the public sector manages private sub-contractors and the private sector need to act more responsibly when supplying the public sector.

I've worked with different methodologies for software solution delivery.  At one extreme I've worked on large public sector projects using tools such as [TOGAF](http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/), [UML](www.uml.org/), [RUP](http://www.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rup/) and the [Waterfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) approach.  On smaller projects I've used [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) development methods such as [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/).  From a job satisfaction perspective, I much prefer the [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) approach but appreciate that it's not suited to very large projects.  It's really important to pick the right development and governance frameworks based on key criteria such as the size / risk value of the project, the makeup of the organisation and the stakeholder map.  I find that an appreciation of all frameworks is useful and the bits that work from each can sometimes be combined or tailored to good effect.

As an IT architect I think it's better to be a generalist than a specialist. I'm often surprised at how little knowledge some technical architects have outside of their own technology domain. I'm technology agnostic and make technology choices primarily based on requirements and supportability as well as cost. I naturally veer towards open source solutions but appreciate that proprietary technologies may be a more appropriate choice for some environments.  It's definitely cool to say that you hate [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) but the reality is that they do produce fairly usable desktop software that most people understand.  Of course I'd sooner be running [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/MainNginx) than IIS any day but in a corporate environment, Windows, Office and Exchange are still the dominant forces for user productivity.  Few organisations have managed to switch their users to Linux desktops and Mac desktops in the corporate environment remain prohibitively expensive in most cases.

It pains me to think that ICT courses in UK schools just aim to teach kids to do word processing or create basic spreadsheets.  At their height they may enable them to set up a basic website.  In my opinion they should be teaching programming or even 'how the internet works'.  Until someone comes up with a decent syllabus, the future of programmers in the UK seems to be in the hands of [Lego Mindstorms](http://mindstorms.lego.com/) and dedicated hobbyists.
